## Specifications
The microcontroller used was the MSP-EXP432P401R LaunchPad from Texas Instruments.
Addistionally, the BOOSTXL-EDUMKII plug-in module was added to the LaunchPad.

The purpose of this game was to use many different serial communication protocols
to interface with the various peripheral devices found on the boards. The protocols
that were used in this project were UART, SPI, and I2C. 

The peripheral devices used were the screen, joystick, push buttons, light sensor,
accelerometer, and a buzzer.

## Other Info
This project was done as a partner project for a microprocessor systems course.

As stated above, the game was designed in C and uses FreeRTOS.
If you wish to demo this project you will need the above mentioned boards,
as well as Code Composer Studio with FreeRTOS.
